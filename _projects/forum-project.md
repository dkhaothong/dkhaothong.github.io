## OVERVIEW

**_Due to a nondisclosure agreement, identifying characteristics and some parameters of the project have been left out._**


I worked on a project where we tested a prototype of a redesigned community support forum. The client's primary goal was to update an outdated community support forum and test the user experience of specific forum features. They were also interested in how users navigated the information architecture of the new forum.  


With a team of four other researchers, we worked with the client and delivered an insightful report with a variety of deliverables. My role involved coordinating respondents, creating research material, conducting usability test sessions, and analyzing the data into actionable insights.

### The original design vs. the new design of the forum.


#### The Challenge:

Community forums are used to discover solutions and to allow open discussion of various topics with other users. In the tech community, these forums are very insightful for developers, designers, and IT professionals. Our challenge, was that a client had recently redesigned the user interface (UI) of their forum and wanted us to test features on prospective users.

#### The Solution:

We were given specific constraints to work with such as what features to test, what main insights were expected from stakeholders, and an average timeframe of the project. We strategized and tailored our strategy to suit these constraints. As we waited for the prototype to be finalized by our client, we began to solve the problem by discovering the type of users that would use the community support forum website.

## DESIGN


#### Understanding the Users:

We made personas of the type of users that would visit so we could accurately recruit relavent respondents. We based our personas based off data from our stakeholder interviews and an analysis of the different forum topics. We divided the types of users into three specific cohorts. We recruited FPGA developers, software developers, and technical support seekers. We recruited five users for each cohort via UserInterviews. The users were screened to get a diverse sample of respondents with different ranges of professional experience and age. 


#### Exploring the Competition: 

 We had an open discussion regarding what everyone thought "good UX" was for community support forums. I described how a great community support forum had a clear ranking system, chunked different information into relavent topics, and kept the visual design as minimal as possible. We analyzed the design of popular community support forums (Reddit, Stack Overflow) so we could build our expertise and provide accurate reccommendations for our client. 


#### Understanding the Flow:

Soon after, we recieved the prototype of the community support forum via InVision. We learned what features we had to test on the prototype and developed the user flow for these different features. Because we did not play a role in the design of the prototype, it was very significant for us to be familiarized with the flow before we conducted any tests.

**We needed to test and evaluate:**


* The registration process.
* The sign-in and log-in process.
* Finding a relavent forum.
* Posting a question
* Posting an image.
* Replying to an existing discussion.
* Translating a post.
* Private messaging another user.

We used an Excel spreadsheet to list all the various user flows for the different features. With the user flows completed and a greater understanding of the prototype, we developed tasks for the different features we needed to evaluate. The scenario-based tasks had to allign with the goals of the task (e.g., registering for the forum) and follow a discussion guide we would use for usability testing.

#### Preparing the Lab:

Before we could conduct any test sessions, we started by creating a discussion guide. This was the most important deliverable we had to develop because it would help us conduct the usability test more effectively, provide key insights for our stakeholders depending on the questions we asked, and give us variety in data (e.g., what users said versus what they actually did).

The discussion guide was essentially a list of behavioral questions that we could probe respondents with. The goal of the discussion guide was to create a direct conversation that could facilitate this conversation. We designed our discussion guide to have open-ended questions and likert-scale based questions after completing moderated tasks. The questions were strategically created to assess findability, template design, content relevancy, and any general UX improvements of the community support forum.


With the discussion guide completed, we practiced a few moderated pilot sessions to get familiar with the timing of the discussion guide and work out any possible technical kinks.

## INSIGHTS

#### What we Discovered:


On testing day, we all tested five respondents from the three different cohorts (FPGA, Software, Tech Support). Some sessions were moderated independently, while some sessions had a notetaker to assist. All sessions were recorded using a remote meeting software called GoToMeeting.


I worked as a notetaker and a independent moderator. We discovered that overall, most respondents were able to generally complete the tasks we designed with success. However, some respondents also struggled with tasks related to finding specific types of information. For example, some respondents struggled with finding the registration process and navigating the different search features. 

#### What Clients Learned:

*An example of how our insights were presented to stakeholders.*


With the usability test being a succcess, we all spent time after to discuss our collective experiences. After talking for hours with respondents, our heads were filled with information and we needed to synthesize our experiences. A presentation was created highlighting the background of the study, our methodology, and key takeaways. The presentation was chunked into the different tasks and featured a summary of our notes from a specific task, a quote from a respondent, and an actionable reccomendation.

## CONCLUSION

#### What I Learned:


Overall, I learned that remote user research studies can be a great way to gain insights from users quickly. The duration of the project took roughly two weeks and our client got an in-depth perspective on what features to prioritize for their product. In addition, I also discovered how difficult it was to independently moderate a usability session with no partner. Having to take notes, moderate the respondent, and have a conversation at the same time proved to be quite difficult.
