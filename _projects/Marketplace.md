## OVERVIEW

**_Due to a nondisclosure agreement, many details of the project have been left out. Contact me for further discussion._**


#### The Problem 
Partner marketplaces allow partners to promote applications, services, and solutions to drive business growth. Specifically, they allow partners to generate sales leads, create offerings, and market solutions to enterprise customers.


We worked with the client and another design agency in a collaborative setting to build, test, and validate designs of the partner marketplace. 


My role within the team involved conducting usability test sessions, creating research material, analyzing the data into actionable insights, and making design recommendations.


#### The Solution

The partner marketplace was designed in different batches of fidelity. We played a key role in testing the different batches and communicating what aspects of the design worked/didn't throughout these multiple stages. Overall, I interviewed roughly 18 users during this process and made key design reccommendations that were implemented by designers. 


## CONCLUSION

#### What I Learned

* **Document all of your info :** Organizing ideas from brainstorming sessions and meeting notes allowed me to revisit ideas that were conceived from earlier parts of the process but forgotten. They may prove to be viable solutions in the future. 
* **If the question can drive a change to the product, ask the question :** Whether it's during a usability test session with a respondent or a meeting with a stakeholder, these spontaneous questions can have enormous value into further understanding the "why?".
