## OVERVIEW


**Project is currently being written up and finalized. Please stay tuned.**
This was a solo design exercise for a job interview at an undisclosed startup. During this exercise, I was tasked with redesigning a library catalog interface. Specifically, I sought to create a universal library catalog system that could be used globally by other libraries. 

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/placeholder.jpg">

</div>

#### The Challenge

Library catalogs are used to find physical books, e-books, and other resources available. Every library has their own specific catalog system, so what if you were looking for a specific item and wanted to compare the availability of this book at different libraries? Introducing WorldCat, a union catalog that itemizes the collections of over 72,000 libraries to create a massive catalog of data. Despite solving a usability problem, WorldCat remains outdated by lacking a mobile version. My challenge, was to develop a mobile interface in 72 four hours.
