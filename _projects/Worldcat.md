## OVERVIEW


**Project is currently being written up. Please stay tuned.**
This was a solo design exercise for a job interview at an undisclosed startup. During this exercise, I was tasked with redesigning an existing interface by adding, updating, or removing features. I naturally gravitated towards redesigning a library catalog interface due to past frustrating experiences. Specifically, I sought to develop a library catalog interface that could be used globally by other libraries. 


#### The Challenge

Library catalogs are used to find physical books, e-books online, and a variety of other resources. Every library has their own specific catalog system, so what if you were looking for a specific item and wanted to compare the availability of this book at different libraries? Introducing WorldCat, a union catalog that itemizes the collections of over 72,000 libraries to create a massive catalog of data. Despite solving a usability problem in library catalogs, WorldCat remains outdated by lacking a mobile version. My challenge, was to address a problem associated with an existing user interface, conceptualize how to fix that problem, and present a short example highlighting the changes I made to the existing user interface.
