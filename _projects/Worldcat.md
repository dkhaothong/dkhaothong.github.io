## OVERVIEW


This was a solo design exercise for a job interview at an undisclosed startup. During this exercise, I was tasked with redesigning an existing interface by adding, updating, or removing features. I naturally gravitated towards redesigning a library catalog interface due to past frustrating experiences. Specifically, I sought to develop a library catalog interface that could be used globally by other libraries. 


#### The Challenge

Library catalogs are used to find physical books, e-books online, and a variety of other resources. Every library has their own specific catalog system, so what if you were looking for a specific item and wanted to compare the availability of this book at different libraries? Introducing WorldCat, a union catalog that itemizes the collections of over 72,000 libraries to create a massive catalog of data. Despite solving a usability problem in library catalogs, WorldCat remains outdated by lacking a mobile version. My challenge, was to conceptualize how a mobile interface would look and present a example highlighting the changes I made to the existing user interface.

## RESEARCH

 
#### Evaluating the Navigation 

I began by creating a user flow of the desktop version of the website. Specifically, I was interested in determining the flow of how users would navigate the website when searching for an item using the catalog. This was important because it would allow me to prioritize what information needed a strong call-to-action when designing the mobile interface.

## DESIGN

#### Creating Wireframes

With the user flow completed, I began to create wireframes of the mobile interface. Since this was a design exercise with a concrete deadline, I focused on developing wireframes of pages I felt needed the highest priority. These were the search page, the search results page, and the item page.
