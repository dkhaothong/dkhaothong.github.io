## OVERVIEW


#### The Context

This was a solo design exercise to showcase my design process for a job interview at an undisclosed startup. During this exercise, I was tasked with redesigning any existing interface by adding, updating, or removing features. I naturally gravitated towards redesigning a library catalog interface due to a past frustrating experience. Specifically, I sought to redesign a library catalog interface that has been used globally by other libraries in the world.


#### The Challenge

Library catalogs are used to find physical books, e-books online, and a variety of other resources. Every library has their own specific catalog system, so what if you were looking for a specific item and wanted to compare the availability of this book at different libraries? Introducing WorldCat, a union catalog that itemizes the collections of over 72,000 libraries to create a massive catalog of data. Despite solving a usability problem in library catalogs, WorldCat remains outdated by lacking a mobile version. My challenge, was to conceptualize how a mobile interface would look and bring the user experience of the desktop version to a mobile setting.

## RESEARCH

 
#### Evaluating the Navigation 

Since this was a design exercise, I knew that any research on users I could conduct in the early stages was quite limited. If I had the time, I would have created personas of users to keep in mind user pain points as I designed. I began by creating a user flow of the desktop version of the website to orient myself. Specifically, I was interested in determining the flow of how users would navigate the website when searching for an item using the catalog. This was important because it would allow me to prioritize what information needed a strong call-to-action when designing the mobile interface.

## DESIGN

#### Creating Wireframes

With the user flow completed, I began to create wireframes of the mobile interface. I focused on developing wireframes of pages that were critical to the task of searching for a item in the library catalog. These were the search page, the search results page, and the item page. I sketched these out via pen and paper.

#### Prototyping a Mockup

A more developed mockup was created to showcase an example of a visual style guide that could be used and bring the ideas of in my low-fidelity wireframes to life.

## CONCLUSION

#### What I Learned

Although I didn't land the gig, I did learn how to design under new constraints and improved my ability to justify my design choices with stakeholders and product managers. As a designer just beginning my career, I also learned that design exercises are less about the final product, but rather about being able to showcase the reasoning behind what you designed.
