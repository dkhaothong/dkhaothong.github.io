## OVERVIEW


**Project is currently being written up and finalized. Please stay tuned.**
This was a solo design exercise for a job interview at an undisclosed startup. During this exercise, I was tasked with redesigning a library catalog interface. Specifically, I sought to create a universal library catalog system that could be used globally by other libraries. While doing competitive analysis research, I had discovered there was already a website called WorldCat that implemented this idea I had brainstormed. However, the website had no mobile-friendly version, so I sought out to create a design of how the mobile version would look and behave.
