## OVERVIEW

Due to a nondisclosure agreement, identifying characteristics and some parameters of the project have been left vague.


I worked on a project where we tested a prototype of a redesigned community support forum. The client's primary goal was to update an outdated community support forum and test the user experience of specific forum features. They were also interested in the information architecture of the new forum.  We worked with the client and delivered an insightful report with deliverables. 

#### The Challenge:

Community forums are used to discover solutions and to allow open discussion with other users. In the tech community, these forums are very insightful for developers, designers, and IT professionals. Our client had recently redesigned the UI of their forum and wanted to test it out. 

#### The Solution:

We were given specific constraints to work with such as the features to test, what main insights were expected, and an average timeframe of the project. We started wih discovering who would use the community support forum website.

## DESIGN


#### Understanding the Users:

We made personas to determine the type of users that would visit so we could accurately recruit the relavent respondents. We divided the types of users into three specific users. We recruited FPGA developers, software developers, and technical support seekers. Using a list of good-standing recruited respondents and UserInterviews.com, we coordinated with our respondents for the test. We recruited subjects remotely from across the United States.
