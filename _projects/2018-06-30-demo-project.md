Science 37 is a scientific research services and technology company. Its primary focus is to pave the way for breakthroughs in medicine and new treatments by allowing patients to participate in clinical research trials directly from their homes.

The Challenge
Despite the benefits of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the medical industry, there are still significant problems with this technology. There continues to be miscommunication and data breaches which creates vulnerability in patient records. Science 37 seeks to restructure EHRs by developing a secure and robust health record system using blockchain technology.  

The Solution
To allow for patients, not healthcare providers, to have the ability to securely store and control their healthcare records. Creating a mobile application to store health records by utilizing blockchain technology will allow for medical records to be more secure, increase data access, and improve patient doctor communicatio
## OVERVIEW

Due to a nondisclosure agreement, identifying characteristics and some parameters of the project have been left vague.


I worked on a project where we tested a prototype of a redesigned community support forum. The client's primary goal was to update an outdated community support forum and test the user experience of specific forum features. They were also interested in the information architecture of the new forum.  We worked with the client and delivered an insightful report with deliverables. 

#### The Challenge:

Community forums are used to discover solutions and to allow open discussion with other users. In the tech community, these forums are very insightful for developers, designers, and IT professionals. Our client had recently redesigned the UI of their forum and wanted to test it out. 

#### The Solution:

We were given specific constraints to work with such as the features to test, what main insights were expected, and an average timeframe of the project. We started wih wondering who would use the community support forum website.
