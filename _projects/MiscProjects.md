#### OVERVIEW


I led and developed a desktop wireframe for a user research agency website. The design was developed through a competitive analysis of other agency websites and an analysis of the existing website. There was a strong developmental focus on the information architecture and content to improve credibility for prospective clients that would visit the website. The wireframe was built on Sketch and iterated through remote meetings.

#### OVERVIEW


Api’s Floral is a floral shop located in San Jose, CA. My client wanted a landing page as the website was being developed and a prototype a developer could work with. The developmental process was heavily focused on aligning the visual branding with my client’s vision and making the website scannable. The landing page was built using Wix and the prototype was developed on Sketch.
