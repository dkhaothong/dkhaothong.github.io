# Let's Get Personal.

Hi, I'm Derek Khaothong. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I currently reside today. I studied cognitive science at the University of California, Los Angeles because I'm passionate about increasing my knowledge of how we think, act, and feel.


I explore the fields of visual design, technology, and behavioral science to apply interdisciplinary perspectives when I design and research experiences. I take pride in learning about others' stories and being a lifelong learner.


I'm currently at [Medallurgy UX](http://medallurgy.com) on a project-based basis as a user research assistant. To be a better researcher, I'm currently improving my facilitation and collaboration skills. I'm looking for full-time opportunities in user experience design or research.


Outside of UX, you can find me noodling on my guitar, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.

# Let's Chat.

I'd love to talk: opportunities to collaborate, my experiences as a first-generation college graduate, or my journey into UX.


Shoot me an e-mail and we can work something out!
