## Let's Get Personal.

Hi, I'm Derek Khaothong. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I currently reside today. I have a background in digital media and studied cognitive science at University of California, Los Angeles.
I explore the fields of design, technology, and behavioral science to apply interdisciplinary perspectives to create multi-faceted experiences. As a designer, I love to think about solutions to major or minor inconveniences facing the world. I take design inspiration from things you see everyday like the color palettes of different sneakers, album artwork on glossy vinyl covers, and the organization of grocery stores.


In the past, I've worked for [UCLA's Computational Lab](http://cvl.psych.ucla.edu), [Medallurgy UX](http://medallurgy.com), [UCLA Radio](https://uclaradio.com); and [Inneract Project](https://inneractproject.org). 


Outside of design, you can find me trying to rap over J Dilla beats, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.

## Let's Chat.

I'd love to talk about anything - from design, user research, or the history of electronic dance music. 


Shoot me an e-mail and we can work something out.
