## Who are you?

Hi, I'm Derek. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I'm a Bay Area native with a background in digital media and studied cognitive science at University of California, Los Angeles.
I explore the fields of design, technology, and behavioral science to apply interdisciplinary perspectives to create multi-faceted experiences. I'm inspired by x.


In the past, I've worked for [UCLA's Computational Lab](http://cvl.psych.ucla.edu), [Medallurgy UX](http://medallurgy.com), [UCLA Radio](https://uclaradio.com); and [Inneract Project](https://inneractproject.org). 


Outside of design, you can find me trying to rap over J Dilla beats, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.

## Let's Chat.

I'd love to talk about anything - from design, user research, or the history of electronic dance music. 


Shoot me an e-mail and we can work something out.
