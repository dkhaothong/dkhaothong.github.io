# Let's Get Personal.

Hey, my name is Derek Khaothong. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I currently reside today. I studied cognitive science at the University of California, Los Angeles because I'm passionate about learning how we think, learn, and organize information.


I explore the fields of visual design, technology, and behavioral science to apply an interdisciplinary perspective when I design and research user experiences. I enjoy listening to the stories of other people and being a lifelong learner.


Iâ€™m currently a junior product manager in the EdTech space at [Teachers' Curriculum Institute](https://www.teachtci.com) where I'm working on innovative, award-winning software to deliver an impactful curriculum to teachers and students across the nation.  My biggest interest within tech currently is learning how we can seamlessly integrate software and hardware in a multi-screen experience, at scale. 


Outside of tech, you can find me noodling on my guitar, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.
