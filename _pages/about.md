# Let's Get Personal.

Hi, I'm Derek Khaothong. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I currently reside today. I have a background in digital media and studied cognitive science at the University of California, Los Angeles.


I explore the fields of design, technology, and behavioral science to apply interdisciplinary perspectives when I craft experiences. As a designer, I love to think about intuitive solutions to major or minor inconveniences facing the world. I take design inspiration from things you see everyday like the color palettes of different sneakers, album artwork on glossy vinyl covers, and the organization of grocery stores.


I'm currently at [Medallurgy UX](http://medallurgy.com) doing user research and volunteer for [SF Hep B Free](https://www.sfhepbfree.org/) as a web designer. In the past, I've worked for [UCLA's Computational Lab](http://cvl.psych.ucla.edu), [UCLA Radio](https://uclaradio.com), and [Inneract Project](https://inneractproject.org). 


Outside of design, you can find me noodling on my guitar, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.

# Let's Chat.

I'd love to talk about anything - from design in tech, opportunities to collaborate, or my experiences as a first-generation college graduate. 


Shoot me an e-mail and we can work something out.
