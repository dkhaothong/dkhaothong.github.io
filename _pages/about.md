Hi, I'm Derek. I'm a Bay Area native with a background in digital media and cognitive science. 
I explore the fields of design, technology, and behavioral science to apply interdisciplinary perspectives to create multi-faceted products. 

In the past, I've worked at x, y, and z. 

My last name means 'golden mountain' in Thai. Outside of design, I love to and cook up tasty meals in the kitchen with friends & family.
