# Let's Get Personal.

Hi, I'm Derek Khaothong. My last name means 'Golden Mountain' in Thai.
I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I currently reside today. I studied cognitive science at the University of California, Los Angeles because I'm passionate about learning how we think, learn, and organize information.


I explore the fields of visual design, technology, and behavioral science to apply an interdisciplinary perspective when I design and research user experiences. I take pride in learning about others' stories and being a lifelong learner.


Iâ€™m currently a junior product manager in the EdTech space at [Teachers' Curriculum Institute](https://www.teachtci.com) where I'm working on innovative, award-winning software to deliver an impactful curriculum to teachers and students across the nation.  My biggest interest within tech currently is learning how to seamlessly integrate software and hardware in a multi-screen experience, at scale. Right now, I'm reading [Conversational Design by Erika Hall](https://abookapart.com/products/conversational-design).


Outside of tech, you can find me noodling on my guitar, cooking up tasty meals in the kitchen with others, and hiking in the Bay Area.
